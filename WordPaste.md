# Introduction #

The WordPaste plugin attempts to intercept paste actions and cleanse them of rich text markup that tends to get inserted when pasting from programs like Word.

To use this plugin, simply instantiate it as one of the plugins on an HtmlEditor. A button in the toolbar will allow the paste cleansing functionality to be enabled and disabled by the user. The functionality is enabled by default.
